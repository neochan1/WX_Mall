	This is a mini program about mall. In the project,I will show you a common mini program's structure and some functions.

â€‹	The program mainly includes the following parts and what I want to show  is mainly about pages,components and requests.

Pages contains the following modules:

* authorization

* cart 

* category

* collect

* goods_detail

* goods_list

* index

* login

* pay

* search

* user

And the above modules can can mode in your phone. I think it will be fantastic!

The components packages the search input and tables module. It is convenient for me to write the repeated code.

The request module encapsulate some asynchronous JavaScript and XML requests. This can make our request more fast and efficient. And I use promise to prevent the hell of the callback function.
